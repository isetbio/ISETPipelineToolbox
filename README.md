## Class and Function
 * coneMosaic: Compute cone response from RGB image displayed on a typical monitor, include various model of the visual front end.   
 
 * imageEstimator: Ridge and LASSO regression based image reconstruction method, simple and fast but only works for relatively small images.  
 
 * patchEstimator: patch-wise reconstruction with model of natural image statistics, work with large images but computational intensive.    
 
 * imageHelper/visualHelper: Various helper function for our project.
